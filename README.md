# 🤖 Chatbot using Groq LLM + LangChain

This project is a **chatbot prototype** built using **LangChain** and powered by the **Groq LLM**. It runs entirely inside a **Google Colab notebook**, making it easy to test and iterate quickly without setting up a separate app or frontend.
This is NOT a conversational chatbot (no memory used).
For a full conversational bot, memory and higher-level chains like ConversationalRetrievalChain can be added later.

## 📒 Project Overview

The chatbot accepts user input and returns intelligent responses using Groq’s fast LLM. It demonstrates working with LangChain's chaining mechanisms and LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to streamline prompt handling and response generation.
